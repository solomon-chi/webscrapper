# Simple Web Scraper

This Python script is a basic web scraper that extracts and prints all the hyperlinks (URLs) found on a given webpage. It uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

-   `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
-   `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content.

You can install them using pip:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```
